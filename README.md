It establishes connections with a MySQL database to perform CRUD operations on entities like doctors, patients, and appointments. It includes routes to retrieve, create, update, and delete records for doctors, patients, and appointments.Additionally, it provides endpoints to fetch counts of doctors, patients, and appointments.Overall, it forms a RESTful API for managing hospital-related data with basic authentication and error handling.
